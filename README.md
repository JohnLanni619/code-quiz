# Code-Quiz

## Description
The goal of this project was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write.

## Key Points
1. When the start button is clicked, the timer starts and the first question is presented
2. When a user answers a question, they are presented with another question
3. When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
4. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over
5. When the game is over, the user is able to enter their initials and save their score
